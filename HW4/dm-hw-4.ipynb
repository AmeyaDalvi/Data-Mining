Long-Term Pet Ownership Can Slow Cognitive Decline in Older Adults, New Study Finds. A new study reveals that owning pets for more than five years can slow cognitive decline in older people. A team at the University of Michigan studied over 1,300 people with an average age of 65 and found that owning a pet long-term staved off aging in the brain. However, the benefits were more significant for Black people, college-educated people, and men. The results of the preliminary study are due to be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 74th Annual Meeting held in Seattle in April. Prior studies have suggested that the human-animal bond may have health benefits like decreasing blood pressure and stress, study author Dr. Tiffany Braley of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor told SWNS. Our results suggest pet ownership may also be protective against cognitive decline, she added. All the study participants had average cognitive skills at the beginning of the six-year study. Researchers used data from the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study to look at 1369 people, 53% of whom owned pets, 32% were long-term pet owners — defined as those who owned pets for five years or more. Of study participants, 88% were white, 7% were Black, 2% were Hispanic, and 3% were of another ethnicity or race. Researchers used cognitive tests to develop a composite cognitive score for each person, ranging from zero to 27. The score included tests of subtraction, numeric counting, and word recall. Researchers then compared participants' composite cognitive scores with years of pet ownership and cognitive function. Over the six years, cognitive scores decreased at a slower rate in pet owners, with the difference strongest among long-term pet owners. Considering other factors known to affect cognitive function, the study showed that long-term pet owners, on average, had cognitive scores that were 1.2 points higher at six years than the non-pet owners' scores. The researchers also found that the cognitive benefits associated with long-term pet ownership were more substantial for black adults, college-educated adults, and men. Dr. Braley said more research is needed to explore the possible reasons for these associations further. As stress can negatively affect cognitive function, the potential stress-buffering effects of pet ownership could provide a plausible reason for our findings, Dr. Braley said. A companion animal can also increase physical activity, which could benefit cognitive health. That said, more research is needed to confirm our results and identify underlying mechanisms for this association, she added.\",\n\n\"Owning a pet, like a dog or cat, especially for five years or longer, may be linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults, according to a preliminary study released today, February 23, 2022. Prior studies have suggested that the human-animal bond may have health benefits like decreasing blood pressure and stress, said study author Tiffany Braley, MD, MS, of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. Our results suggest pet ownership may also be protective against cognitive decline. The study looked at cognitive data from 1,369 older adults with an average age of 65 who had normal cognitive skills at the start of the study. A total of 53% owned pets, and 32% were long-term pet owners, defined as those who owned pets for five years or more. Of study participants, 88% were white, 7% were Black, 2% were Hispanic and 3% were of another ethnicity or race. Researchers used data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large study of Medicare beneficiaries. In that study, people were given multiple cognitive tests. Researchers used those cognitive tests to develop a composite cognitive score for each person, ranging from zero to 27. The composite score included common tests of subtraction, numeric counting and word recall. Researchers then used participants' composite cognitive scores and estimated the associations between years of pet ownership and cognitive function. Over six years, cognitive scores decreased at a slower rate in pet owners. This difference was strongest among long-term pet owners. Taking into account other factors known to affect cognitive function, the study showed that long-term pet owners, on average, had a cognitive composite score that was 1.2 points higher at six years compared to non-pet owners. The researchers also found that the cognitive benefits associated with longer pet ownership were stronger for Black adults, college-educated adults and men. Braley says more research is needed to further explore the possible reasons for these associations. As stress can negatively affect cognitive function, the potential stress-buffering effects of pet ownership could provide a plausible reason for our findings, said Braley. A companion animal can also increase physical activity, which could benefit cognitive health. That said, more research is needed to confirm our results and identify underlying mechanisms for this association. A limitation of the study was that length of pet ownership was assessed only at one time point, so information regarding ongoing pet ownership was unavailable. The study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 74th Annual Meeting being held in person in Seattle, April 2 to 7, 2022 and virtually, April 24 to 26, 2022. The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institute on Aging.\",\n\n\"A new study reveals that owning pets for more than five years can slow cognitive decline in older people.

They can also decrease depression and physical pain and, in many cases, provide a sense of purpose. A new study suggests that pet ownership is even better for older people than previously known. This preliminary study, released by researchers at the University of Michigan, has linked long-term pet ownership to delayed aging of the brain in adults over 65. The new data will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 74th Annual Meeting in Seattle in early April. Prior studies have suggested that the human-animal bond may have health benefits like decreasing blood pressure and stress, said Tiffany Braley, M.D., of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, who oversaw the study, in a press release. Our results suggest pet ownership may also be protective against cognitive decline. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, an examination of 1,369 Medicare beneficiaries, Braley’s work looked at cognitive data from older adults with an average age of 65 who had normal cognitive skills at the start of the study. A total of 53 percent owned pets, and 32 percent were long-term pet owners who had owned their animals for five years or more. For that Medicare study, researchers measured cognitive function through various tests, including number counting, subtraction problems and word recall. Participants received a cognitive score ranging from 0 to 27 based on how well they performed. Over six years, cognitive scores decreased at a slower rate in pet owners, especially for the one-third who fell into the long-term pet owner category. On average, they had a cognitive composite score that was 1.2 points higher compared to non-pet owners. Those cognitive drops were even lower in Black participants, men and older adults with a college education. I definitely think having a pet makes a difference, says caregiver Lorie Martan, 60. Anything that helps stimulate the brain is good — plus all the love you’re giving to that animal.\",\n\n\"Having a long-term pet companion may delay memory loss and other kinds of cognitive decline, a new study has found. Pet ownership was especially beneficial for working verbal memory, such as memorization of word lists, according to the preliminary research. To our knowledge, our study is the first to consider the effect of duration of pet ownership on cognitive health, first author Jennifer Applebaum, a sociology doctoral candidate and National Institute of Health predoctoral fellow at University of Florida, told CNN in an email.And it's not just cats and dogs that can boost the brain. People in the study also cared for rabbits, hamsters, birds, fish and reptiles, Applebaum said, although dogs were most prevalent, followed by cats. Owning household pets for five years or more produced the most benefit, delaying cognitive decline by 1.2 points over the six-year period of the study compared with the rate of decline in people without pets, said clinical neuroimmunologist Dr. Tiffany Braley, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan, via email. These findings provide early evidence to suggest that long-term pet ownership could be protective against cognitive decline, said Braley, senior author of the study to be presented in April at the American Academy of Neurology's 74th Annual Meeting. Why did having pets for more than five years have the most positive impact? The study, which could only show an association, not a direct cause and effect between pet ownership and cognition, was unable to answer that question.However, previous studies have pointed to the negative effects of stress on brain health, especially chronic stress, Braley said. Prior research has also identified associations between interactions with companion animals and physiological measures of stress reduction, including reductions in cortisol levels and blood pressure, which in the long term could have an impact on cognitive health, she said.There can also be a multitude of other brain benefits from pet ownership, such as social companionship and a sense of duty and purpose, experts say. Having a pet or multiple pets combines many core components of a brain-healthy lifestyle, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine. Cognitive engagement, socialization, physical activity and having a sense of purpose can separately, or even more so in combination, address key modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease dementia, said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study.The study analyzed cognitive data on more than 1,300 adults who participated in the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study tracking the lives of Americans age 50 and older.Anyone with cognitive decline at the start of the research was excluded from the analysis. In the final sample, over 53% owned pets. Pet owners tended to be of higher socioeconomic status, which could also be a reason for the benefits: Experts say people with more income are more likely to visit doctors and take care of their health. Any brain boost associated with owning pets over five years was more prominent for Black adults, college-educated adults, and men, the study said. More research is needed to explain these findings, Applebaum said. Because previous research has been mostly among biased samples that consisted primarily of White women, we are lacking sufficient information about men (and other genders) AND people of color, especially Black pet owners, she said. Does this mean you should run right out and get a pet if you're an older adult interested in preserving your brain? Not necessarily, experts say. Studies have also shown that pet owners can be lonely, depressed and have chronic conditions that may make pet ownership a negative. We do not recommend pet ownership as a therapeutic intervention, Applebaum said. However, we do recommend that people who own pets be supported in keeping them via public policy and community partnerships. Abolishing pet fees on rental housing and providing free or low-cost vet services would go a long way toward helping pet owners keep their pets, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, Applebaum said. Other ideas include providing foster or boarding support for people who are unexpectedly unavailable to care for their pets due to a health crisis. An unwanted separation from a pet can be devastating for a bonded owner, and marginalized populations are most at-risk of these unwanted outcomes, she said.\",\n\n\"Turns out having a pet companion may delay cognitive decline or memory loss according to a new study, CNN reports. To our knowledge, our study is the first to consider the effect of duration of pet ownership on cognitive health, Jennifer Applebaum, a sociology doctoral candidate and National Institute of Health predoctoral fellow at University of Florida, told CNN. In addition to cats and dogs, people who cared for rabbits, birds, fish, hamsters, and reptiles benefited from a reduction in memory loss. Dogs were most prevalent, followed by cats, Applebaum added. People benefit most when they have their pet companion for more than five years. The study showed a cognitive decline of 1.2 points over six years. These findings provide early evidence to suggest that long-term pet ownership could be protective against cognitive decline, said Dr. Tiffany Braley, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan. Why does this happen? Well they aren’t exactly sure. Some experts believe that stress in general is bad for long term brain health. Prior research has also identified associations between interactions with companion animals and physiological measures of stress reduction, including reductions in cortisol levels and blood pressure, which in the long term could have an impact on cognitive health, Braley said. There’s also a number of other ways it may help. Cognitive engagement, socialization, physical activity and having a sense of purpose can separately, or even more so in combination, address key modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease dementia, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine. Looks like it isn't just dogs who are man's best friend.\",\n\n\"Did you know that having a furry friend by your side can improve your mental health and memory loss? Researchers at the University of Michigan revealed that having pets can also slow cognitive decline over time, as it delays brain aging for people in their 60s and older. Prior studies have suggested that the human-animal bond may have health benefits like decreasing blood pressure and stress, Dr. Tiffany Braley declared, explaining that preliminary results suggest pet ownership may also be protective against cognitive decline. The study lasted six years and took into account 1,300 adults with normal cognitive skills. 53 percent of people in the research are former pet owners, while 32 percent have been longtime pet owners, and it was concluded that cognitive skills decreased at a slower rate in participants that own pets, and slowed for long-term owners. Additionally this seemed to be more beneficial for men. And this is not all, researchers included rabbits, hamsters, birds, fish and reptiles in the study, however it was found that dogs were most prevalent” in the study, followed by cats.” Dr. Braley explained that stress can negatively affect cognitive function and the potential stress-buffering effects of pet ownership could provide a plausible reason for our findings, adding that a companion animal can also increase physical activity, which could benefit cognitive health.\"\n]\n\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\nX = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)\nwords =
